# Repository neural_activity_Circular_BP

File generate_neural_activity.ipynb generates 'fMRI neural activity' corresponding to running (extended) Circular Belief Propagation on a probabilistic graphical model corresponding to a probability distribution on binary variables, which can be factorized into a product of pairwise potentials (with factors [[w,1-w],[1-w,w]]) and unitary potentials.
